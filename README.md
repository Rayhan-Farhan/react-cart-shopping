# React cart for ecommerce

This project is built for the REPLIQ Jr. ReactJS Practical Challenge.

Project is built using React with Typescript for better experience and to enhance error checking so that it can be checked during pre-compilation.

Project consists of JSON files to use as a localAPI, contextAPI was used to share the data across the components and for better state management, hooks such as useState was used to track the functional components and to use state variables in application, hooks help to maintain the application lifecycle.

Vite was used here for instant feedback of the result during the development which is very fast compared to the standard webpack

It also contains react-router-dom for Navigation and Routing from components to components. 

And Tailwind CSS was used for stylings. 

There might be some bugs inside.
